- get databank progress
(x,x) -> check calculations to assert current status 
(x) -> if crashed try to rerun by usng less nodes and more memory 

 All of them converged, but: 
 Sc_-1_2 -> OOM -> more memory -> half number of procs, twice memory per proc (this also shows that it is a per proc memory problem), also give more time (6 instead of 3 hours) [ x ]
 Sc_20_1 -> one electron doesnt work
 Sc_4_1 -> >Time Out -> more Time [ x ]
 
 -> see why compile script doesnt work as intended 
 	-> i did not have fchk data 
 		-> generated fchk data needs weird rename, why ? maybe ask Leila ? 

Sc [x] is 
 		
 -> as soon as compile script works, upload the .msg data
